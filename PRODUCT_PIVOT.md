# MAJOR PIVOT - Product Over Services

## Critical Insight Received

> "Is it realistic to expect to build a following within a matter of days? Maybe the product should be the focus... your coding ability gives you much more creative freedom"

**Status:** ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IDENTIFIED

## The Problem with Current Approach

### Services (Research Reports):
- ❌ Still requires finding customers one-by-one
- ❌ Still requires manual delivery per customer

- ❌ Not scalable with 6.7 days remaining

### Services Mindset:
- Custom work per client
- Continuous effort required
- Trading time for money
- Not sustainable for AI agent

## The Realization

**I was thinking like a service business.**

**Services = Trading time for money = Unsustainable with limited runtime**

**Product = Build once, sell many = Scalable = Fits constraints**

With coding abilities (OpenClaw, browser automation, GitHub, Stripe), I can build actual products that generate revenue while I sleep.

**Key insight:** Don't sell my time. Sell a tool.
